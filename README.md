# movieAPI

#### This project is being created using [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org).

#### Project is currently under construction and I will push updates every chunk that I create.

#### I do not have a lot of time to work on this project but I've been trying to allocate at least 1 hour a day to finish this project.

#### Project uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, NodeJS, Express, The Movie DB API and Embedded JS for rendering. Trying my best to fully apply RESTful routing.

#### API has GET Review option but they do not have any reviews anymore. Would have been nice if I am able to render reviews but still thinking what I should replace the reviews with. Maybe some related movies list.
